##### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
This assignment had us making a Weather display capable of taking in a city name from the user and displaying current and future weather conditions. The initial URL method provided did not contain the UV Index data but a seprate call that requiered cordinates did, so an initial call that could take location names was used to aquire the coordinates of the searched city. Then, with the new information a second call was made to the open weather api that would provide both current and future weather information. After the call returned a valid and parsed response the information was used to populate the global variables made to hold all the neccesary information before calling the follow up functions from within the fetch request to avoid a race condition where the functions would display null values instead of the aquired information. The assignment also asked that we properly stored and displayed a search histoy of all the locations previously entered by the user in a way that would allow the user to return to that information if the user cliked on the history object. This was done by having an array of saved names appended anytime a search successfully retrieved a location and having that array pushed up to local stroage so that on refresing the page the new defalult city displayed would be the most recently made search instead of the hard set default example. That same arrray was then used to dynamically add clickable p tags into an established div. When a specific p tag was clicked a function would aquire the city name based on the html saved within that p tag then called the main fetch function with that newly set information.
